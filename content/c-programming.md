The C programming language is a powerful, efficient, and flexible language that is widely used for system and application software. It was developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs and has since become one of the most popular programming languages in the world. In this blog, we will explore the fundamentals of C programming, its features, and how it can be used to solve various coding problems.

## Features of C Language

C is known for its simplicity and efficiency. Some of its key features include:

- **Portability**: C programs can be run on different machines with little or no modification.
- **Rich Library**: C provides a rich set of built-in functions and operators.
- **Speed**: C is a compiled language, which makes it faster than interpreted languages.
- **Pointer Manipulation**: C allows direct manipulation of memory through pointers.
- **Modularity**: C supports modular programming, which helps in organizing code into functions.

## Basic Syntax

Here's a simple C program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}


```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int age = 25;
    float height = 5.9;
    char initial = 'A';

    printf("Age: %d\n", age);
    printf("Height: %.1f\n", height);
    printf("Initial: %c\n", initial);

    return 0;
}
